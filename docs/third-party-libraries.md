# About 3rd Party Libraries in Add-ons

We maintain a list of banned and unadvised third-party JavaScript libraries; these libraries are not allowed/recommended in add-ons (because of security vulnerabilities).

## Banned libraries

### AngularJS `1.x`

We allow the latest 1.x version at submission time; previous versions are not accepted.

### jQuery `1.x`

jQuery versions older than 2.0 are not supported by the jQuery team for development inside extensions. Please use a recent version.
